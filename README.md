# WaferDCGAN
In this notebook, we ill build a simple DCGAN to generate synthetic images of WM-811k data. WM-811K is an open source dataset that include semiconductor WBM collected from 46,393 lots in real-world semiconductor industries. The same logic for WBM applies here such that defective dies have logic `1' and normal dies are represented by logic `0'. The properties included in the WM-811K dataset are \texttt{waferMap}, \texttt{dieSize}, \texttt{lotName}, \texttt{waferIndex}, \texttt{trainTestLabel}, and \texttt{failureType}. In total the data consists of 811,475 WBMs, 21.3\% of the WBMs in the dataset have labels. Among labeled WBMs, 3.1\% have failure patterns while 18.2\% do not have patterns. The failure patters are eight in total namely Centre (Figure \ref{ch4:center}), Donut (Figure \ref{ch4:donut}), Edge-Loc (Figure \ref{ch4:EdgeLoc}), Edge-Ring (Figure \ref{ch4:EdgeRing}), Loc (Figure \ref{ch4:Loc}), Near-Full (Figure \ref{ch4:Near-full}), Random (Figure \ref{ch4:Random}), and Scratch (Figure \ref{ch4:Scratch}). Figure \ref{fig:subpie} summarises the distribution of data for WM-811k dataset. In this chapter, labelled and patterned data that account for 3.1\% of the total will be considered.
